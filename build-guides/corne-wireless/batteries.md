# Batteries

Installing the batteries is a simple but particular step. This guide will go over the positioning and installation of them.

## Battery Orientation

1. Position so the yellow taped side is on the bottom rather than top
2. Flip the battery so the wires are on the inside of the PCB
3. The battery wire should be sliding between the nice!view socket and the inner socket for the nice!nano

## Installing the Battery

1. Plug the battery's JST connector into its jack on the PCB
2. You may have some excess wire due to tolerances. Try to push it in so it won't interfere with the switch plate without damaging the wire

## Completing the Stack

1. Now that the battery is in, you can insert your nice!nano back into its sockets
2. If you have a nice!view, you can insert it into its sockets

## Wrap Up

You have your batteries, nice!nano, and nice!view installed! In the next guide, we'll go over the display cover.
