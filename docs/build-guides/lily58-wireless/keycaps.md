# Keycaps

Keycaps are the final step in the physical build process. This guide will go over the keycaps and how to install them.

## Types of Keycaps

 - **1U**: These are used for most keys
 - **1U homing**: These are used for your homing keys. These are usually F and J in QWERTY layouts but can be different depending on your layout.
 - **1.5U**: These are your thumb keys for the corner of the Lily58

## Installing the Keycaps

1. Line up the keycap with the switch insert
2. Push down firmly

## Wrap Up

This is a pretty simple and self-explanatory step. You now have your keycaps installed! In the next guide, we'll go over firmware.
