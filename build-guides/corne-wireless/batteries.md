# Batteries

Installing the batteries is a simple but particular step. This guide will go over the positioning and installation of them.

:::caution
This guide is meant for the batteries that we sell on our store. If you are an international customer sourcing your batteries yourself, please follow the tips at the bottom.
:::

## Battery Orientation

1. Position so the yellow taped side is on the bottom rather than top
2. Flip the battery so the wires are on the inside of the PCB
3. The battery wire should be sliding between the nice!view socket and the inner socket for the nice!nano

## Installing the Battery

1. Plug the battery's JST connector into its jack on the PCB
2. You may have some excess wire due to tolerances. Try to push it in so it won't interfere with the switch plate without damaging the wire

## Completing the Stack

1. Now that the battery is in, you can insert your nice!nano back into its sockets
2. If you have a nice!view, you can insert it into its sockets

## Wrap Up

You have your batteries, nice!nano, and nice!view installed! In the next guide, we'll go over the display cover.

## International Customers

Unfortunately, we cannot ship batteries internationally. Because of this, here's a list of helpful tips for sourcing your batteries:

 - Pay attention to polarity! Battery polarity is not standardized. Compare the battery you're looking to purchase with the ones we sell to ensure you're getting the right polarity.
 - Amazon and AliExpress are your best bets for purchasing the batteries you need from our experience. 
   - *If you find a better retailer in your country, let us know so we can list it here*
 - If you want the battery to fit underneath the nice!nano, you can't go much larger than 301230. It can *maybe* fit a 401230, but it's a tight fit.
   - Battery names are their dimensions. 301230 is 3.0mm x 12mm x 30mm.
 - If you don't want to deal with sourcing the JST connector, you can solder the battery directly to the B+ and B- pads on the nice!nano
