# Introduction

Our Corne Wireless is made to make the perfect wireless keyboard. We made the following major changes to the Corne:

 - Power Switch: Turn off your board when traveling or when not in use
 - JST Jack: Easily and safely install your batteries
 - nice!view Support: Install your nice!view directly without a bodge wire
 - Partially Assembled: No need to solder the hotswap sockets, diodes, reset button, power switch, or JST jack
 - Choc PCB: Our Choc PCB is using Choc spacing, which makes it more compact than usual

You can customize your wireless in 3D Corne at the [keyboard customizer](https://typeractive.xyz/pages/build).
