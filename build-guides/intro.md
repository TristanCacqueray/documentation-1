# Introduction

These build guides will walk you through the process of building their respective keyboard. They will go over the tools you'll need and the assembly steps. Please feel free to contribute to these guides by clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, let us know if anything should be changed on our [Discord server](https://typeractive.xyz/discord).
